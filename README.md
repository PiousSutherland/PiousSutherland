> # @PiousSutherland at your service
DevOps Engineer with a passion for scripting and ~being lazy~ **automating** tasks

I love RegEx, ![not that anyone cares](https://i.makeagif.com/media/12-04-2017/sDosxm.gif)

### 🌱 Here's how I'm growing and what I'm learning:

#### 📝 Mobile app for playlist generation, with a twsit (in .NET C# / MAUI)

#### 💬 Build a chat server (pp)

#### 📆 Excel calendar automation (pp, uses API)

#### 🔐 some Cybersecurity thrown in via ISC2.org

> ##### pp = personal project
